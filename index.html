    <h1>Breonna Taylor</h1>
    <p> This website will serve as an educational experience for myself and others as we all learn about the details of
        the Breonna Taylor case. It was just announced that the only charge in her case will be for endangering her
        neighbors. This racist miscarriage of justice must not be silenced. My goal is to educate as well as provide
        next steps on the change we can enact.
