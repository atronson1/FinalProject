        Breonna Taylor was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her mother, Tamika Palmer said, “she was a better version of
        me…full of life. Easy to love” <a

        Her high school scrapbook included the note, “graduating this year on
        time is so important to me because I will be the first in my family to accomplish this… I want to be the one who
        finally breaks the cycle of my family’s educational history. I want to be the one to finally make a difference”

        Her twitter account portrayed a woman who was among other things, loyal, frequently cold, and optimistic about
        the future.

        Breonna had huge aspirations for her future. She graduated from the University of Kentucky, worked as an
        emergency
        room technician at a local hospital, and had dreams of becoming a nurse. In 2019 she wrote a Facebook post as
        her
        uncle was in the process of recovering from a stroke:

        “Working in health care is so rewarding. It makes me feel so happy when I know I've made a difference in someone
        else's life. I'm so appreciative of all the staff that has helped my uncle throughout this difficult time and
        those
        that will continue to make a difference in his life.” <a

        Kenneth Walker was described by her family as “a man who treated her right.” Her home was covered in post-it
        notes
        filled with goals. She just bought a car and was trying to have a baby with her current boyfriend Mr. Walker,
        they
        had already picked out a name <a
