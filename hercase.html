            The main points of contention in the Breonna Taylor case are 1. Did the police officers annouce themselves
            before
            entering Breonna's place of residence? 2. Why did the police raid Breonna Taylor's apartment?
        </p>
        <h3>Did the officers annouce themselves before entering Breonna Taylor's place of residence?</h3>
        <p>
            Both the police and Mr. Walker agree that there was knocking on the door. Both Ms. Taylor and Mr. Walker
            were in
            bed at the time of the late night raid. Mr. Walker states that him and Ms. Taylor called out and asked who
            was
            at the door, to no response <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">(Oppel et
                All).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This fact of the case is critical and witnesses give conflicting testimony about it. During a 911 call
            shortly
            after the shooting, Kenneth says to the operator, "Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend" <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdnrUSwbFn8&ab_channel=ABCNews ">(ABCNews).</a>
            Implying he didn’t know or at least did not explicitly state to the 911 operator that it was the police that
            entered his girlfriend’s house without
            permission. Additionally, Mr. Walker states that he thought the knock was from intruders and didn’t suspect
            it
            could have been police in an interview he gave at the police station three hours after the shooting <a
                href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/07/17/breonna-taylor-lay-untouched-20-minutes-after-being-shot-records/5389881002/">(Duvall
                and Costello).</a>
            Furthermore, the officers were in plainclothes when conducting the raid <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/breonna-taylor-grand-jury-audio-highlights/index.html">(Sanchez).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Johnathan Mattingly told investigators that he knocked once and heard no response: ‘At this point was start
            announcing ourselves “Police! Please come to the door. Police! We have a search
            warrant’” <a
                href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/07/17/breonna-taylor-lay-untouched-20-minutes-after-being-shot-records/5389881002/">(Duvall
                and Costello).</a>
            ) He also told investigators that he banged on the door for 45 seconds to a minute over “six or seven
            different
            time periods.” Mattingly was not interviewed until twelve days after the shooting. New body camera footage
            right
            after the raid shows Mr. Walker in handcuffs stating, “Ya’ll was banging at the door and she said ‘who is
            it?’
            and they started shooting.” Which one officer replies to by stating, “No, no, we announced three times,
            ‘police
            search warrant.’ Don’t try that” <a

            The police entered Ms. Taylor’s house with a battering ram <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/breonna-taylor-grand-jury-audio-highlights/index.html">(Sanchez).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Neighbors interviewed by CNN stated that they were awakened by the gunfire and thus did not hear what
            proceeded
            it <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/breonna-taylor-grand-jury-audio-highlights/index.html">(Sanchez).</a>.
            This does imply
            that whatever form of entry the police used was not loud enough to wake up the neighbors. Vice News also
            states
            that over 12 neighbors told them they did not hear the officers. However one neighbor while being
            interviewed
            stated that he remembered the officers saying, “This is the cops” when interviewed in May. However, the same
            witness stated that he did not hear anyone identify themselves as police back in March <a

        <h3>Why did the police raid Ms. Taylor’s apartment?</h3>
        <p>
            The investigation being conducted was with regards to two men who were believed to be selling drugs out of a
            house that was nowhere near Mrs. Taylor’s residence. The judge signed the warrant because they believed the
            apartment may have been used to receive packages involved
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">(Oppel et
                All).</a> Breonna Taylor was dating one of the suspects on
            and off but recently had severed ties according to a family lawyer

            It is important to note that at the time of the raid, the police had already located the main suspect of the
            investigation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">(Oppel et
                All).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Several people have pointed out it is frustrating to many that there was no police body camera footage of
            the
            raid itself.

        <p>
            A swat team was across town executing a raid for a related crime but had no idea that the raid was being
            done on
            Ms. Taylor’s apartment. They state the first time they had heard of the raid is when the news that an
            officer
            had
            been shot was announced over the radio and they were called to the scene for assistance

        <h3>Possible Conflicts of Interest and Questionable Police Behavior </h3>
        <p>
            A problematic email that was sent at 2:06 AM by Sargent Johnathan Mattingly stated in part “I know we did
            the
            legal,
            moral, and ethical thing that night” <a

            Body camera footage shows allegedly Brett Hankinson in Breonna Taylor’s apartment after she was killed,
            which
            some
            argue gave him the opportunity to remove or manipulate evidence. According to Lousiville Metro Police
            Department’s
            own protocol, officers that are involved in the use of deadly force must be separated and paired with an
            escort
            officer as to prevent tampering with evidence. Body camera footage shows the officers involved wandering
            around
            the
            crime scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a>
            However,
            body camera footage
            shows
            Brett Hankinson coming to front door and asking “Is anybody here dead?” and then walking directly into the
            crime
            scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Brett Hankinson travels to the hospital to visit Mattingly. Chief Steve Conrad stated that “I
            was
            surprised by [Hankinson in the ER] because the typical response is that someone from public integrity is
            usually
            tasked with keeping up with the officers involved to make sure they get back [to the police station]."
            Hankinson
            made contact with the police cheif but it is unclear if he made contact with any other officers <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a>
            After the shooting body camera footage shows incredibly hostile police officers arresting Mr. Walker after
            the
            incident. Several officers are seen with their guns pointed at Mr. Walker, with one aggressively shouting
            “Walk
            back
            or I’ll send this dog on you. Walk back to me. Keep on walking.” as a police dog lurches towards Mr. Walker.
            He
            can
            be heard crying as he steps towards the officer. Additional footage here
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a> shows Walker
            asking
            through tears, “What did I
            do?” to which the officer responds “You’re going to fucking prison. That’s what’s going on. For the rest of
            your
            fucking life.”

            Additionally, there was a grand jury proceeding where Brett Hankinson was charged for endangering Breonna
            Taylor’s
            neighbors but no one was charged for her murder, leading to protests and public outcry.
            One grand juror filed a motion to make the information shared in the hearing public stating the attorney
            general
            was
            using the jury proceedings to deflect accountability and shield himself from backlash
