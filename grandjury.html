    <h2> Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Proceedings</h2>
    <h3> What is an Attorney General and a Grand Jury?</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="dc" src="images/cameron1.jpg" alt="Daniel Cameron" title="Daniel Cameron photo">
        The man person to know regarding Ms. Taylor’s grand jury proceedings is Daniel Cameron. He is the Kentucky
        Attorney
        General that has been presiding over this case since its inception. The usa.gov website defines an attorneys
        general’s office as one that are the top legal officers in their state or territory, they act as the “People’s
        Lawyer” for citizens <a
            href="https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general#:~:text=Attorneys%20general%20are%20the%20top,People's%20Lawyer%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20citizens.">(usa.gov).</a>
        According to Cornell Law, a grand jury exists to, “determin[e] if there is probable cause if a criminal offense
        has
        been committed” <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/grand_jury#">(Cornell).</a> They are held in private
        and are an investigative body that acts independently of the
        prosecuting attorney and the judge.
    </p>
    <h3>Announcement of the Grand Jury Results</h3>
    <p>
        On a press conference that Daniel Cameron held himself after the grand jury proceedings (a clip is attached
        below),
        he announced that the only charges brought about by the grand jury proceedings was three counts of wanton
        endangerment. No one was injured in the apartment <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUqn2A7XaWk&ab_channel=CBSThisMorning ">(CBS).</a> Kentucky statutes
        define wanton endangerment as the
        following:
    </p>
    <div>
        A person acts wantonly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense
        when
        he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or
        that
        the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross
        deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.
        These charges would be given to Brett Hankinson for shooting through the glass window and into the neighbor’s
        apartment.
    </div>
    <h3>Two Grand Jurors Anonymously Come Forward</h3>
    <p>
        Two anonymous grand jurors have come forward to ask that grand jury proceedings be made public (they have been
        at
        this point), after they were outraged by the Attorney General’s speech. The cited two main points; incomplete
        evidence, and no possible indictments for manslaughter or similar charges.

        “It wasn’t the grand jury who made this decision, it was Daniel Cameron and his office” – unidentified grand
        jury
        member <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aTW74O1Dc&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice).</a>

    </div>
    <h4>Incomplete Evidence</h4>
    <p>
        In a Vice News interview, one of the jurors stated that he was worried about a cover up. Since the public
        integrity
        unit was internal to the police force, they likely had a vested interest in not prosecuting their colleagues.
        They
        stated the public integrity unit was “throwing [the officers] softball questions,” implying the internal
        investigation did not do enough to interrogate their own officers <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aTW74O1Dc&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice).</a> Additionally, the
        anonymous jurors
        were
        told questionable conduct would be discussed later but that never came to fruition, leaving “holes in their
        stories”
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aTW74O1Dc&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice).</a> Additionally, At least one
        bullet that goes through Breonna Taylor’s roof and up through the roof of the
        apartment above her that was never recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some interviews, including the public integrity unit’s interview with the chief of police at the time, the
        jurors do
        not recall hearing while in the jury room, “selected evidence was not presented” <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aTW74O1Dc&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice).</a>
        Additionally, one juror stated that he found Kenneth Walker more credible than any of the officers, whose
        stories
        did not line up. Kenneth Walker’s story goes directly against that of the officers.
    </p>
    <h4>No Possible Indictments for Manslaughter or Criminal Charges </h4>
    <p>
        During a news conference about the grand jury proceedings, Daniel Cameron stated, “While there are six possible
        homicide charges under Kentucky law, these charges are not applicable to the facts before us because our
        investigation showed, and the grand jury agreed that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their return in
        deadly
        fire” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUqn2A7XaWk&ab_channel=CBSThisMorning ">(CBS).</a> When
        interviewed by CBS, the jurors stated that the first time they had heard of those six possible
        murder charges was during the press conference. The jury had not been made aware of these possible charges and
        therefore did not consider them.

    </div>
    <p>
        During an interview with CBS News, the unnamed jurors’ attorney Kevin Glogower states that normally grand jurors
        are
        presented with the law and charges to then decide which charges are applicable based on facts presented. He said
        “it
        looked like they weren’t following the grand jurors and only wanted the grand jurors to follow them” <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUqn2A7XaWk&ab_channel=CBSThisMorning ">(CBS).</a> In
        an
        interview with Vice the anonymous jurors stated, “We weren’t made aware of any additional charges we could
        consider
        and when we asked, they just said that they wouldn’t apply” <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aTW74O1Dc&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice).</a>

    <h3>
        Breaking Down Several Statements Made in the Press Conference
    </h3>
    <h5>All quotes below are from Daniel Cameron's press conference held on September 23rd, 2020.</h5>
    <div class="quotes">
        “Evidence shows that officers both knocked and announced their presence at the apartment. The officers statement
        about their announcement are corroborated by an independent witness who was near, in a proximity to,
        [Ms.Taylor’s
        Apartment].”
    </div>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the “Her Case” page under the header “Did the officers announce themselves before entering
        Breonna
        Taylor’s place of residence,” Neighbors interviewed by CNN stated they were awoken by gunfire and did not hear
        what
        proceeded it. There was one neighbor who, when interviewed in March, stated that they did not hear police
        announcing
        themselves. However, when interviewed again in May, he stated he remembered the officer’s saying, “this is the
        cops.” Despite this contradicting testimony from their previous statement, in addition to being the only
        non-police
        witness who stated hearing anything.
    </p>
    <div class="quotes">
        “In total, six bullets struck Ms. Taylor. Medical evidence obtained by our team indicates that only one shot was
        fatal.”
    </div>
    <p>
        This either points out that if the officer’s intent was just to injure Ms. Taylor, they failed at doing so, but
        only
        once, or the officer’s intent was to kill Ms. Taylor, they were only able to successfully shoot a fatal wound
        once.
        There were 32 rounds shot into the apartment.
    </p>
    <div class="quotes">
        “With a thorough and complete knowledge of evidence collected in this case, lawyers with our office of special
        prosecutions, presented the findings of our independent investigation before a grand jury comprised of Jefferson
        county residents.”
    </div>
    <p>
        The simple invoking of the word “our” in this instance suggests it was not independent. The police have a vested
        interest in not having the officers charged with manslaughter. The attorney general appears to have a strong
        hand in
        the way these proceedings were handled and interest aligned with the police officers. Cameron stated in an
        interview
        with ABC affiliate WBKO, “It is not our judgement that there should be other charges that the grand jury should
        be
        advised of” <a
