    <h3> What happened during the shooting?</h3>
    <p>
        Walker states that him and Ms. Taylor put on clothes and grabbed a gun, frightened by the late night banging. He
        said they had not made it down the hallway to the front door before it “comes off its hinges” <a
            href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/07/17/breonna-taylor-lay-untouched-20-minutes-after-being-shot-records/5389881002/">(Duvall
            and Costello).</a> Mr. Walker then said he “let off one shot,” adding “I still can’t see who it is or
        anything” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Walker states that he did not know the people entering his house were police officers and fired once in
        self-defense, hitting Sargent Mattingly in the leg.
    </p>
    <p>
        In response the police fired two waves of bullets consisting of 32 rounds total into the apartment, killing Ms.
        Taylor <a
            href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/breonna-taylor-grand-jury-audio-highlights/index.html">(Sanchez).</a>The
        first
        grouping of shots was instigated by Mr. Walker’s one shot that hit Mattingly. The second grouping of shots
        appeared
        unprovoked. Mr. Walker never fired a second round.

        Hankison, who has since been fired from his position “shot 10 rounds blindly into the apartment”

        Breonna Taylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a>
        Hankison stated he believed that the
        officers were, “all getting sprayed with bullets.” Likely the sound he heard was of police spraying bullets into
        Breonna’s apartment <a

        Hankison in a 911 call after the shooting believed that his fellow officer Sargent Mattingly had been shot by
        someone with an “A.R,” referring to an automatic rifle <a

        He later stated in an police integrity unit interview that he sees someone “in a shooting stance and it looks as
        if
        he was holding, he or she was holding, an A.R. 15 or a long gun, a rifle”
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lbdXJx2CtQ&ab_channel=VICENews">(Vice News).</a> The only gun found at
        the scene was a small handgun.

    <p>
        Taylor had five gunshot wounds, the one to her left breast was deemed the fatal shot<a

        Mr. Walker was first arrested and charged with attempted murder of a police officer, the charge was dismissed in
        May

        The commanding swat officer called to the scene when observing the scene stated, “our initial thought is, oh
        they’re
        shooting out the window at the police” <a

        At the crime scene, the ambulance that was on standby outside of the apartment has been dismissed an hour before
        the
        raid but was called back to give aid to Mattingly, who had been shot in the leg. Breonna was not given any
        medical
        attention.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">(Oppel

            All).</a> Kenneth states in a police interview
        that he
        shouted, “Somebody come help her!” and heard no response. Kenneth first calls Breonna’s mother, then 911.

        Mr. Walker added, “"What really made me not realize it was the police was because nobody was like rushing in
        after
        all this happened. They all like stayed outside, so I'm like, what the heck was that?"
        <a

            and Costello).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to dispatch logs, Breonna did not get any medical attention for 20 minutes after she was fatally shot.
        Additionally, the police did not radio about Taylor still being inside the apartment until almost a half an hour
        after the shooting.

        Body camera footage from the swat team shows an officer involved in the raid explaining the situation to the
        swat
        team member stating “’[Walker] said she’s down. She’s dead. But we weren’t rushing in there to check’”
